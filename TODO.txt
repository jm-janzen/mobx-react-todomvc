Hi JM,

Nice talking to you this afternoon - really enjoyed hearing about some of
the projects you've worked on and I learned about a couple automation tools
that I think we could make use of so thank you.

Please find the development exercise below. The amount of code change required
is not huge but it does require you to read the Mobx documentation and understand
how the existing app works in order to make the necessary changes.

1. Clone the example app from the repository listed below and get it running
   locally. Read the README to understand how Mobx helps you manage your
   application state. Review the code and get an understanding for how it works.

    https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-todomvc 

2.  Try to add the following customizations:
    GOAL 1

        Enable users to specify one or more tags in order to categorize todo items.     > [x]
        For example, if I create a todo item with the text "Contact candidates to
        explain the coding exercise", I might want to add a couple tags,
        for example "Hiring" and "Urgent".

        We're interested to see the functionality working but it doesn't have to
        look super pretty. That said, there are various packages that provide a
        React-based component for adding/selecting tags and you are welcome
        to use such a package.

    GOAL 2

        Add an additional row of filter buttons to the footer, with one for each        > [x]
        unique tag that's been added to any items. Continuing with my example
        from above, once I've added "Urgent", and "Hiring" tags to one or more
        items, I should see two new filter buttons (one for "Urgent",
        one for "Hiring") and when I click one of these buttons it should filter
        the list of visible todos to only those with the corresponding tag.             > [ ]

        Please try to get your submission back to us by Monday January 22nd.
        Thanks again and good luck!
